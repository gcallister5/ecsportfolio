           <h3>Inspiration</h3>
           <img src="images/interest.jpg" alt="Andreas Fransson" width="300" >
           <p> The reason Andreas Fransson is one of my skiing inspirations is because he is a freestyle skiier that would ski through places like the patagonian backcountry 
             and he was fearless while skiing it.</p>
           <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
           <p>While I've never skiied as a ski team I ski pretty regularly with friends, family, or just by myself. I like to ski past the expert gates and explore new and challenging 
               terrain such as moguls, gullies, or chutes. My favorite places to ski are Alta and Brighton. </p>
           <h4>Maps</h4>
